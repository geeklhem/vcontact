# This is a very old version of vContact that was written during my master degree ! 

It does not reflect the current version of vContact and should **NOT** be used in production.
I keep this repository for **historic purpose only**, since I am no more involved in the development of vContact.

vConTACT lives here now: 
>    Bolduc B, Jang HB, Doulcier G, You Z, Roux S, Sullivan MB. (2017) 
>    vConTACT: an iVirus tool to classify double-stranded DNA viruses that infect Archaea and Bacteria. PeerJ 5:e3243 
>    https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3243
